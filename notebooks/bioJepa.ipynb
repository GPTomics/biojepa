    "**Goal**\n",
    "Our goal is to build a World Model for cell biology. In it's current configuration, our model calculates that hitting a cell with a specific gene knockout, or drug if we had it in the dataset, causes specific biological pathways to activate or shut down. Unlike an LLM, this is a predictive simulation that operates entirely within a compressed mathematical space to understand cause and effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process begins with the inputs, which feed the model three distinct pieces of information for every training step. \n",
    "\tFirst, it receives the **Before** state, which is data representing a healthy control cell. Instead of a messy list of 20,000 raw gene counts, the tokenizer has already compressed this into a structured set of pathway scores (using [Reactome Pathway 2024 data](https://maayanlab.cloud/Harmonizome/dataset/Reactome+Pathways+2024)). This essentially tells the model that the cell currently has high energy, low stress, and normal growth. \n",
    "\tSecond, the model receives the **Action**, which is the specific perturbation performed in the lab, in our case a CRISPR knockdown of a specific gene. This could also be a drug application or protein introduction if we had the data. This is converted into a learnable \"Action Embedding,\" effectively serving as the command that tells the simulation what event just occurred. \n",
    "\tThird, the model is given the **After** state, which is the actual knockdown cell observed in the experiment. This third input serves purely as the target or \"ground truth\"; the model is not allowed to see it while making its prediction, but uses it afterwards in the loss calculation and backprop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the model, a three-step simulation plays out to process these inputs. It starts with the **Student Encoder**, or the *Perception* module, which looks at the healthy **Before** cellinput  and compresses it into a Latent State. At this stage, the model is simply understanding the baseline biological status of the cell. This latent representation is then passed to the **Action-Conditioned Predictor**, which acts as the *Physics Engine.* This component combines the cell's current state with the Action vector. Using a mechanism called Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN), the action actually modulates the internal weights of the neural network, effectively shifting the physical rules of the simulation to match the drug's effects. The **Predictor** then tries to predict, or hellucinate, what the future state of the cell will be, calculating a new vector that represents the cell's condition after the knockout, or drug impact. \n",
    "\n",
    "To validate the predictor, simultaneously the **Teacher Encoder** looks at the real **After** data from the lab and encodes it into that same latent space to serve as the judge. To learn, the model compares the predictor output against the Teacher's reality. With backprop, we attempt to minimize the difference between the prediction and the actual outcome, trying to minimize this error over millions of examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, by forcing its predictions to match reality, the model moves beyond simply memorizing data and begins to learn the underlying causal rules of biology. It figures out gene regulatory logic—understanding that if Gene A is knocked down, Pathway B must functionally fail. It learns how different pathways, like inflammation and cell death, are causally linked. Ultimately, we hope it learns the \"physics\" of how perturbations work, allowing us to eventually simulate the effects of gene mutations, drugs or genetic interventions on cells without having to perform the physical experiment in a wet lab."
